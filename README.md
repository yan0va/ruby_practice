#Introduction to Ruby

##Makers Academy Week 2 Exercises


#####Ruby 1 and Ruby 2 
Exercises from [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy) hackpad to learn the very basics of Ruby programming language. 


###Tasks


#####Ruby 3 

* Take the method provide_mortgage?() from the "Boolean logic" section and decide if it would return true or false for these inputs without running the code:

	```
	salary 30,000, deposit 50,000, property_value 200,000
	salary 30,000, deposit 50,000, property_value 300,000
 	salary 50,000, deposit 40,000, property_value 200,000
	salary 80,000, deposit 100,000, property_value 500,000
	salary 35,000, deposit 60,000, property_value 300,000
	salary 25,000, deposit 30,000, property_value 150,000
	```
* Then run the code with these inputs and see if you're right or wrong.
* Extend the provide_mortage?() method to require 5% deposit if the value of the property is less than 650,000 and 20% if it's 650,000 or more.
* Extend the provide_mortgage?() method to waive the limit on the loan amount if the deposit is 75% or more.
* Extend the method to accept another argument, a boolean value indicating if the borrower is currently bankrupt. Modify the method to never provide a mortgage to a bankrupt person.

#####Ruby 4

* Write a Ruby program that creates a file called 'hello_from_ruby.txt'
* Make your program ask for input and store that input for later use.
* If the user types 'save', make your program save the input into the file.
* If the user types 'read', show the content of the file.
* If the user types 'introspect' make the program print itself to the screen.
